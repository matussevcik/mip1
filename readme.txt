program about sold cars

the program writes out information about sold cars from file to standard output when "v" is the input 

when "o" is the input the program then takes a date from the standard input in format yyyymmdd and if the file was opened then it writes out information about revenue the seller made from the sale, it only writes it out if he has worked there for at least a year

when "n" is the input and the file has been opened the program creates an array of the number plates of the sold cars

when "s" is the input and the array has been created it writes out the number plates from the array in format AA BBB CC

when "m" is the input and the array has been created it finds the character with the highest number of occurence in the array

when "p" is the input the program checks if each number plate is a palindrome, and if it is a palindrome then it is writen out on the screen

when "z" is the input the program finds the munber plate of a region in which most cars were sold and the writes it out 

when "b" is the input the program finds and writes out the number of occurences of figures in the array

when "k" is the input it ends the program
